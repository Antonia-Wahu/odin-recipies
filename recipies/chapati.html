        Description
    </h2>
   <p>
        Most people complain about chapatis not being soft, Some blame it on the flour, others on the temperature of the water being used; Others swear by hot water, others cold water and even warm water.
        I decided to give a step by step guidance on how to hack a soft layered chapati.
        The trick to getting a soft chapati boils down to 2 things
        1. How you knead your dough... Don't be in such a hurry... Work on your dough thoroughly.
        2. The heat should not be too high nor too low.
        The temperature of the water being used to knead doesn't matter.

        <li>2 Tablespoon Margarine(Optional)</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Sugar(Optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon salt</li>

        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix flour, sugar and salt. Add Margarine, mix with hands to form crumbs. 
            I use a little bit of sugar in mine because I love the savoury taste. Omit it, if you don't like sugar.</li>
        <li>
            Make a well and pour water bit by bit as you knead. 
            Knead for atleast 5 mins, if the dough is sticky, add flour bit by bit as you knead.</li>
        <li>
            Continue kneading on your work surface for another 3 mins. 
            (FOR SOFT CHAPATIS, YOU SHOULD KNEAD THOROUGHLY)
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally dough should be firm but soft and not sticky. 
            Cover with a damp cloth/ cling film/plastic polythene bag for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            After 30mins, knead again and cut into balls.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll out the balls in a circular shape with a rolling pin, 
            one at a time and brush with oil, as shown in the pics.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold as shown.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll the balls out again forming the circle.(Layers should be visible on the rolled out dough).
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium heat, place your skillet, let it warm up. 
            Then put your chapati ontop. Fry both sides until brown. 
            Once cooked remove and place it in a containee and cover.
        </li>
    </ol>
