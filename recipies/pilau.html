        Description
    </h2>
   <p>
        Pilau dish is common in India and the Middle Eastern countries, 
        each with its way of preparing it. The East African pilau rice is common 
        in countries around the Swahili coast like Kenya and Tanzania; hence, 
        it is also called Swahili pilau. Although there are a lot of Indian 
        influences in the local cuisine of the countries around the Swahili coast, 
        The Kenyan or Swahili pilau is more similar in appearance to 
        the Middle Eastern version with a light brown colour than the Indian pilau with bright yellow colour 
        from the addition of turmeric
